# [Symmetry-Adapted Basis](@id symmetry-adapted-basis)

Many noncommutative polynomial optimization problems carry a structural
symmetry: relabel the operators in some prescribed way, possibly with a sign
flip, and the objective and constraints come back unchanged. The CHSH Bell
inequality is the canonical example — it is invariant under swapping Alice's
two measurements (with a sign flip), under swapping Bob's two measurements
(with a sign flip), and under swapping the two parties.

When such a symmetry exists, the moment matrix that the relaxation builds is
not just positive semidefinite — it commutes with the corresponding group
action. By the standard representation-theoretic argument (the *symmetry-adapted
basis*), this large PSD constraint splits into several smaller, independent PSD
blocks, one per isotypic component. NCTSSoS exploits this to shrink the SDP
the user actually sends to the solver.

This page covers the **exploit** half of the symmetry story: consuming a
group that is already known. The complementary **find** half — discovering
Clifford symmetry groups automatically from a Pauli Hamiltonian, including
symmetries that fix no individual term and that inspection routinely misses —
is covered in [Clifford Symmetry Detection](@ref clifford-symmetry-detection).
The worked comparison of manual, detected, and combined groups is in
[Pauli Symmetry Reduction](@ref pauli-clifford-symmetry). The dedicated
order-2 XXX Heisenberg path that combines Pauli charge sectors, spatial site
symmetries, and singlet moment constraints is covered in
[Pauli Charge/Singlet Symmetry](@ref pauli-charge-singlet-symmetry).

This page describes how that support is wired in **today**, what is and isn't
in scope, and how the pieces interact. It is intentionally aligned with the
implemented MVP, not a broader future redesign.

## [What "symmetry-adapted basis" means here](@id sab-meaning)

In the linear-algebra sense, a symmetry-adapted basis is a change of basis on
the half-basis ``B`` (the monomials indexing the rows and columns of the moment
matrix) that block-diagonalizes the action of the symmetry group ``G`` on
``B``:

```math
U^\top \, M_B \, U \;=\; \mathrm{blockdiag}\!\big(M^{(1)}, M^{(2)}, \ldots\big),
```

where each ``M^{(i)}`` corresponds to one isotypic component and the ``U`` is
built from ``G``-equivariant projectors. Because the moment matrix is
``G``-invariant, the off-diagonal coupling vanishes and the *single* large PSD
constraint ``M_B \succeq 0`` is equivalent to *several* smaller PSD constraints
``M^{(i)} \succeq 0``.

In NCTSSoS this idea is used **internally only**, to decide how to split one
PSD block into several smaller PSD blocks for the solver. Externally, the
relaxation continues to live in ordinary monomial coordinates: every PSD entry,
every constraint, every moment variable is still a monomial (or a polynomial in
monomials). The user does not have to think in terms of irreducible
representations to use the feature.

## [Key architectural decision: thin internal adapter](@id sab-decision)

There are two reasonable ways to bolt symmetry adaptation onto a moment-SOS
package:

1. **Rewrite-the-package approach.** Replace the canonical monomial basis with
   symmetry-adapted linear combinations everywhere — in the polynomial type,
   the simplification rules, the term-sparsity graph, the registries. Every
   moment variable becomes a coefficient on an irreducible component.

2. **Thin-adapter approach.** Keep monomials and polynomials exactly as they
   are. Build the moment problem normally. Use the symmetry-adapted basis only
   as a tool to decide *how to slice* one PSD constraint into several smaller
   ones, and emit those smaller blocks back in ordinary monomial coordinates
   (after orbit-reducing moment variables to one representative per orbit).

NCTSSoS deliberately takes approach **(2)**. The rest of the package — the
algebra hierarchy, the registries, `Polynomial`, `NormalMonomial`, the
correlative/term-sparsity machinery, the JuMP construction in
`MomentProblem`/`SOSProblem` — is not touched. The symmetry path lives in a
single file (`src/optimization/symmetry.jl`) and only takes over one job:
constructing a *reduced* `MomentProblem` from the same inputs the dense path
uses.

The output of the symmetry path is therefore an ordinary
[`MomentProblem`](@ref NCTSSoS.MomentProblem) just like the one produced by the
non-symmetric path — just with fewer moment variables and several small PSD
blocks instead of one big one.

## [Supported MVP scope](@id sab-scope)

The current MVP is intentionally narrow and is enforced by fail-fast checks in
[`SolverConfig`](@ref) handling. Symmetry reduction is supported only when
**all** of the following hold:

- **Dense** relaxation — `cs_algo = NoElimination()` and
  `ts_algo = NoElimination()`.
- **Single clique** — exactly one correlative-sparsity clique.
- **Ordinary polynomial problems** — `PolyOpt` over `Polynomial`. State and
  trace polynomial problems are not yet supported on the symmetry path.
- **Monoid, Pauli, or supported fermionic algebras** — `A <: MonoidAlgebra`
  (i.e. `NonCommutative`, `Projector`, `Unipotent`) with
  [`SignedPermutation`](@ref) actions; `PauliAlgebra` with
  [`CliffordSymmetry`](@ref) actions, optionally layered with
  [`PauliChargeSectorSpec`](@ref) and [`PauliSingletConstraintSpec`](@ref);
  or `FermionicAlgebra` with [`FermionicModePermutation`](@ref) and optional
  sector/spin splitting. See [Pauli Symmetry Reduction](@ref
  pauli-clifford-symmetry) for Clifford examples,
  [Pauli Charge/Singlet Symmetry](@ref pauli-charge-singlet-symmetry) for the
  order-2 XXX Heisenberg path, and [`sympleq_symmetry_spec`](@ref) for
  automatic Clifford detection.
- **Real signed-permutation or Clifford actions** — monoid-algebra group
  elements act on registry indices via permutations with ``\pm 1`` signs;
  Pauli group elements act via Clifford conjugation
  (``g \cdot P = U_g P U_g^\dagger``). No general orthogonal action, no
  complex characters.
- **Conservative finite-group decompositions** — the plain finite-group path
  accepts only multiplicity-free scalar isotypic components. The Pauli
  charge-sector path is a specialized order-2 branch that builds explicit
  charge/spatial blocks; see [Pauli Charge/Singlet Symmetry](@ref
  pauli-charge-singlet-symmetry).

Anything outside this scope raises an `ArgumentError` instead of silently
constructing the wrong relaxation. This is the right default while the path
matures: the failure mode for a bug in symmetry reduction is a wrong but
plausible-looking objective, which is much worse than a clear error.

In particular, [`cs_nctssos_higher`](@ref) does not yet accept a
`SymmetrySpec`. The monomap-based GNS path is also not symmetry-aware today:
a symmetry-reduced `result.monomap` does not contain the dense unreduced
moments that `gns_reconstruct` needs, so it currently fails later with an
explicit missing-moments error rather than at the symmetry API boundary.

## [The pipeline](@id sab-pipeline)

When the user passes a [`SymmetrySpec`](@ref) via
`SolverConfig(; symmetry = ...)`, [`cs_nctssos`](@ref) routes the problem
through `moment_relax_symmetric` instead of the regular `moment_relax`. That
function performs the following steps in order:

1. **User supplies a `SymmetrySpec`.** A `SymmetrySpec` wraps a list of
   [`SignedPermutation`](@ref) generators acting on registry indices. Each
   generator records, per index ``i``, a target index ``j`` and a sign
   ``\sigma \in \{-1, +1\}`` such that the operator with index ``i`` is sent
   to ``\sigma \cdot x_j``. Indices not listed are fixed.

2. **The repo enumerates the signed-permutation group locally.** Starting from
   the supplied generators, NCTSSoS does its own breadth-first closure on
   signed permutations restricted to the *active variable domain* (the union
   of all registry indices that actually appear in the objective, the
   constraints, the moment-matrix basis, and any term-sparsity block bases).
   This produces the full finite group as a `Vector{SignedPermutation}`.

3. **Invariance of objective and constraints is checked.** Each enumerated
   group element is applied to the objective and to every equality, inequality,
   and moment-equality constraint. If any of these polynomials changes, the
   call errors out (this can be opted out of via
   `SymmetrySpec(...; check_invariance = false)`, but the default is to
   check). This is a hard prerequisite: if the *problem* is not invariant,
   block-diagonalizing its moment matrix is meaningless.

4. **Basis closure is checked.** The moment-matrix basis of the single clique,
   and the block bases of all term-sparsity blocks, must be mapped to
   themselves (up to sign) by every group element. If any element of the
   half-basis is sent outside the basis, the call errors out. This is what
   guarantees that the action descends to a well-defined linear action on the
   span of the half-basis.

5. **A local monomial action is built.** The function `_act_monomial` applies
   a `SignedPermutation` to a `NormalMonomial` letter-by-letter, multiplying
   the accumulated signs and re-running `simplify` for the relevant
   `MonoidAlgebra`. This is NCTSSoS's NC-aware action; nothing in
   `SymbolicWedderburn` knows about non-commutative words on its own.

6. **A thin adapter exposes that action to `SymbolicWedderburn`.**
   The `NCWordSignedPermutationAction <: SymbolicWedderburn.BySignedPermutations`
   struct, together with a tiny `GroupsCore`-compatible wrapper around the
   enumerated `SignedPermutation`s (`_SignedPermutationGroup` /
   `_SignedPermutationGroupElement`, with explicit multiplication, inverse,
   and order tables), is enough for `SymbolicWedderburn` to reason about the
   action without ever needing to look inside a `NormalMonomial`.

7. **`SymbolicWedderburn` computes the symmetry-adapted decomposition** of the
   half-basis via `SymbolicWedderburn.symmetry_adapted_basis(...)`. The output
   is a list of "blocks", one per isotypic component, each providing the
   change-of-basis rows used to project the moment matrix into that component.

8. **Unsupported plain finite-group decompositions are rejected.** On the
   monomial-coordinate finite-group branch, each returned block must (a) have
   multiplicity 1, (b) be simple, and (c) be 1×1. If any of those checks
   fails, the call errors out with a message indicating which assumption was
   violated. Pauli charge sectors use the separate degree-2 branch described
   next.

9. **Pauli charge/singlet options are layered before emission when requested.**
   If [`PauliChargeSectorSpec`](@ref) is present, the complete Pauli half-basis
   through degree 2 is rewritten into the local ``\{Z,S^+,S^-\}`` charge basis
   and split by total charge. If spatial [`CliffordSymmetry`](@ref) generators
   are also present, NCTSSoS applies a finite Wedderburn split inside each
   charge sector. If [`PauliSingletConstraintSpec`](@ref) is present, order-2
   SU(2)-singlet moment equalities are appended as linear zero constraints.
   Axis-mixing Cliffords are rejected on this branch; only site permutations
   that preserve Pauli axes commute with the charge/singlet structure.

10. **Moment variables are orbit-reduced and a smaller `MomentProblem` is
   emitted.** For each monomial appearing in the relaxation, NCTSSoS computes
   its orbit under the group, picks a canonical representative, and either
   maps the monomial to ``\pm`` that representative or — when the orbit has
   inconsistent signs and is therefore forced to zero by the symmetry — drops
   it entirely. The objective, every constraint matrix, and every constraint
   block is rewritten in terms of these representatives. The constraint
   matrices, after the change of basis induced by the
   `SymbolicWedderburn`-supplied projectors, are also checked to be
   block-diagonal across isotypic components (off-block entries must vanish,
   within `_SYMMETRY_ATOL = 1e-10`); this catches inconsistencies between
   the declared symmetry and the actual algebraic structure. How that
   off-block certificate is computed is controlled by the `offblock_check`
   option of [`SymmetrySpec`](@ref):

   - `:randomized` (default) evaluates every off-diagonal block at
     deterministic pseudo-random values of the orbit-reduced moment
     variables and bounds the result. Each transformed entry is a *linear*
     form in those variables, so vanishing at independent generic points
     certifies the symbolic property; two independent draws are used, and
     the whole certificate runs as dense numeric linear algebra instead of
     symbolic polynomial arithmetic — on large relaxations this is the
     difference between seconds and minutes of construction time.
   - `:full` expands each off-diagonal block symbolically and asserts every
     polynomial entry vanishes. Slowest, but failures point at a specific
     entry — use it to diagnose a failing `:randomized` certificate.
   - `:off` skips the certificate. Only appropriate when re-running a spec
     that has already passed verification on the same problem.

The function returns both the reduced `MomentProblem` and a
[`SymmetryReport`](@ref) summarizing what happened: group order, number of
distinct invariant moment variables, list of PSD block sizes, and the original
half-basis size. On the final [`PolyOptResult`](@ref),
`moment_matrix_sizes` deliberately keeps its old meaning — the pre-symmetry
term-sparsity layout — while the actual reduced solver PSD block sizes live in
`result.symmetry.psd_block_sizes` and are printed separately.

## [What stays local vs. what `SymbolicWedderburn` does](@id sab-boundary)

Keeping the boundary explicit makes it easy to upgrade either side later.

**NCTSSoS-local responsibilities** (in `src/optimization/symmetry.jl`):

- The user-facing types `SignedPermutation`, `SymmetrySpec`, `SymmetryReport`.
- The active-domain computation `_symmetry_domain`.
- Group enumeration `_enumerate_symmetry_group` (BFS closure under composition,
  restricted to the active domain).
- The NC-word action `_act_monomial` / `_act_polynomial` — this is where
  algebra-specific simplification happens, via `simplify(A, ...)`.
- Invariance checks `_check_symmetry_invariance` and basis-closure checks
  `_check_basis_closure`.
- Orbit reduction `_build_orbit_reducer` and the rewriting helpers that map
  every polynomial in the relaxation to orbit representatives, with sign
  bookkeeping and zero-orbit handling.
- The construction of the final smaller `MomentProblem` and the populated
  `SymmetryReport`.

**`SymbolicWedderburn` responsibilities** (called via the thin adapter):

- The actual symmetry-adapted decomposition of the half-basis: computing
  characters, identifying isotypic components, building the change-of-basis
  rows.
- The `multiplicity`, `issimple`, and `degree` queries used to gate which
  decompositions the MVP accepts.

The adapter layer exposing the NC action to `SymbolicWedderburn` is
deliberately small: a `BySignedPermutations` action type, a `GroupsCore.Group`
wrapper (with multiplication, inverse, and element-order tables), and an
`action(::NCWordSignedPermutationAction, g, mono)` method that returns the
permuted monomial together with its accumulated sign. Everything else stays
in NCTSSoS.

## [Why the output is still an ordinary `MomentProblem`](@id sab-output)

After symmetry reduction, the JuMP/SDP layer downstream of
`moment_relax_symmetric` is unchanged: `solve_sdp` consumes a regular
`MomentProblem`, `sos_dualize` would consume a regular `SOSProblem`, the
moment variables are still keyed by `NormalMonomial`s. Only the *contents* of
the `MomentProblem` differ:

- The objective and every constraint are expressed using a small set of
  monomial **orbit representatives** rather than every monomial in the
  original basis.
- What used to be one large PSD block is now several small blocks. Plain
  finite-group reductions may produce scalar blocks; the Pauli charge/spatial
  path produces small charge-sector blocks.
- Off-block constraint entries that, after the change of basis and orbit
  reduction, must vanish are certified to do so (symbolically with
  `offblock_check = :full`, or via the default `:randomized` evaluation
  certificate); if the certificate fails, the call errors out instead of
  silently emitting an unsound relaxation.

This is the central pragmatic gain of the architecture: **no downstream code
had to change**. `JuMP`, `Dualization`, `solve_sdp`, the result types, and the
GNS-side machinery all still speak ordinary monomial moments. The catch is
that monomap-based GNS reconstruction expects a *dense* unreduced moment table,
so a symmetry-reduced `result.monomap` is not directly consumable today. The
reduction is otherwise invisible past the boundary of `moment_relax_symmetric`.

## [Current limitations and fail-fast behavior](@id sab-limits)

!!! note "Where to go next"
    The companion page [Extending Symmetry Support](@ref extending-symmetry)
    audits each of these limitations and what it would take to lift them,
    using the fermionic case as the worked example.


The MVP errors out, rather than silently doing the wrong thing, on any of:

- algebra/spec combinations outside the supported families (monoid + signed
  permutations, Pauli + Clifford/charge/singlet reductions, or fermionic mode
  permutations with optional sector/spin splitting);
- state or trace polynomial problems;
- any active correlative or term sparsity (`cs_algo`/`ts_algo` other than
  `NoElimination()`);
- more than one correlative-sparsity clique;
- term-sparsity block splitting inside a clique (more than one block basis per
  constraint);
- group elements that send a basis monomial outside the basis (basis closure
  fails);
- objective or constraint polynomials that are not invariant under the group
  (unless `check_invariance = false` is passed *and* the user has independently
  verified invariance);
- decompositions returned by the plain finite-group `SymbolicWedderburn` path
  whose blocks have multiplicity > 1, are non-simple, or have size > 1×1;
- constraint blocks whose off-isotypic coupling fails to vanish within
  `_SYMMETRY_ATOL = 1e-10`;
- use via [`cs_nctssos_higher`](@ref), or monomap-based GNS reconstruction
  from a symmetry-reduced solve.

These error messages name the violated assumption and the offending object
(generator, basis monomial, block index) so that misuse is debuggable rather
than mysterious.

## [Reference acceptance case: CHSH](@id sab-chsh)

The current acceptance case is the CHSH Bell inequality with the standard
half-basis ``Q = \{1, x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2\}``. The full setup lives in
`test/problems/bell_inequalities/chsh_simple.jl` and the corresponding
expectation fixture in `test/data/expectations/chsh_simple.toml`
(`Symmetry_d1`).

The symmetry group is generated by:

- an "Alice swap": ``x_1 \leftrightarrow x_2`` together with ``y_2 \to -y_2``;
- a "Bob swap": ``x_2 \to -x_2`` together with ``y_1 \leftrightarrow y_2``;
- a "party swap": ``x_i \leftrightrightarrows y_i`` for ``i = 1, 2``.

These three signed permutations generate a group of order 16. The symmetry
path produces the following acceptance values:

| quantity                  | value                |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| objective                 | ``\approx -2\sqrt{2}``, observed ``-2.82842712455161`` |
| `group_order`             | 16                   |
| `invariant_moment_count`  | 1                    |
| `psd_block_sizes`         | `[1, 1, 1]`          |

In other words: one PSD block of side 5 (the dense moment matrix on ``Q``)
becomes three independent 1×1 PSD blocks, the eleven monomials in the dense
relaxation are collapsed to one nontrivial invariant moment plus the identity,
and the recovered Tsirelson bound matches ``-2\sqrt{2}`` to solver tolerance.
A representative call:

```julia
using NCTSSoS, COSMO

reg, (x, y) = create_unipotent_variables([("x", 1:2), ("y", 1:2)])
f = x[1]*y[1] + x[1]*y[2] + x[2]*y[1] - x[2]*y[2]
pop = polyopt(-f, reg)

alice_swap = SignedPermutation(
    x[1].word[1] => x[2].word[1],
    x[2].word[1] => x[1].word[1],
    y[2].word[1] => (-1, y[2].word[1]),
)
bob_swap = SignedPermutation(
    x[2].word[1] => (-1, x[2].word[1]),
    y[1].word[1] => y[2].word[1],
    y[2].word[1] => y[1].word[1],
)
party_swap = SignedPermutation(
    x[1].word[1] => y[1].word[1],
    x[2].word[1] => y[2].word[1],
    y[1].word[1] => x[1].word[1],
    y[2].word[1] => x[2].word[1],
)

config = SolverConfig(
    optimizer  = COSMO.Optimizer,
    moment_basis = [one(x[1]), x[1], x[2], y[1], y[2]],
    cs_algo    = NoElimination(),
    ts_algo    = NoElimination(),
    symmetry   = SymmetrySpec(alice_swap, bob_swap, party_swap),
)

result = cs_nctssos(pop, config)
result.objective              # ≈ -2sqrt(2)
result.symmetry.group_order   # 16
result.symmetry.psd_block_sizes  # [1, 1, 1]
```

Regression tests for the MVP failure modes (non-invariant objective,
basis-closure violation, multiplicity > 1) live in
`test/relaxations/symmetry.jl`.

## [Contrast with a full symmetry-adapted-coordinate redesign](@id sab-contrast)

It is worth saying explicitly what NCTSSoS is *not* doing, because the phrase
"symmetry-adapted basis" is sometimes used to describe a much more invasive
change.

A hypothetical full redesign would push symmetry adaptation all the way down
into the type system. Polynomials would be expressed natively as linear
combinations of *isotypic basis elements* rather than monomials; multiplication
would carry Clebsch–Gordan-like coefficients; simplification would be defined
on irreducible-representation labels; the `VariableRegistry` itself would be
indexed by ``(\text{irrep}, \text{multiplicity index}, \text{component})``;
and term-sparsity, correlative-sparsity, GNS, and reconstruction would all
have to be re-derived in those coordinates.

NCTSSoS deliberately does **none** of that. It keeps every existing data
structure and rewrite rule intact and uses the symmetry-adapted basis only as
an *internal* tool, late in the pipeline, to slice one PSD block into several.
The benefits of that conservative choice are:

- The non-symmetry path is exactly as before — no risk of regression in the
  much larger code surface that does not use symmetry.
- All downstream code (JuMP construction, dualization, GNS, reconstruction,
  result types) sees ordinary monomial moments and needs no changes.
- The symmetry feature is concentrated in one file and one boundary.

The cost is that the generic finite-group MVP is still restricted to
multiplicity-free, scalar-block cases. Higher-dimensional irreducible blocks
(multiplicity > 1, non-scalar isotypic components) require a richer
intermediate representation that the package does not yet maintain. The Pauli
charge/spatial branch is deliberately narrower: it earns higher-dimensional
small blocks by using an explicit order-2 charge basis rather than pretending
the generic representation problem is solved. Lifting the generic restriction
is a future extension of this same boundary, not a rewrite of the rest of the
package.
