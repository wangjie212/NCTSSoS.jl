# [Fermionic Ground State (XY Model)](@id fermionic-ground-state)

This example computes **certified lower bounds** on the ground-state energy
of a quantum spin chain — and it does so by translating the problem into the
language of **fermions**.  If those words don't mean anything to you yet,
good — we'll build every concept from scratch.

## What is a ground-state energy?

Every quantum system has a ladder of allowed energy levels.  The **ground
state** is the lowest rung — the state the system settles into when all
thermal energy is removed (absolute zero).  Its energy $E_0$ is the smallest
the system can ever have.

A natural guess is that this minimum energy should be zero — a perfectly
still, inert system.  But quantum mechanics forbids it: the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle requires every bound particle to retain some residual
motion ("zero-point energy"), so $E_0$ is generically nonzero.  For the
spin chains in this example, $E_0$ turns out to be *negative*, reflecting
how quantum correlations between neighbouring spins lower the total
energy.  The precise value of $E_0$ encodes essential physics: phase
transitions, stability, and the nature of those correlations.

## Bosons vs. fermions — the two families of particles

Nature divides all particles into two families based on a single rule about
**swapping identical particles**:

- **Bosons** (photons, Higgs): the quantum state is *unchanged* under a
  swap.  Bosons happily pile into the same quantum state — this is why
  lasers work.
- **Fermions** (electrons, quarks, neutrons): the quantum state picks up a
  **minus sign** under a swap.  This sign has a stunning consequence called
  the **Pauli exclusion principle**: no two fermions can occupy the same
  state.  (If two were in the same state, swapping them should change the
  sign, but also change nothing — both conditions require the state to be
  zero, i.e. it cannot exist.)

The Pauli exclusion principle is why atoms have shells, why matter doesn't
collapse, and why white-dwarf stars resist gravity.

## Creation and annihilation operators

Tracking many-particle quantum states by writing wavefunctions
$\psi(x_1, x_2, \ldots)$ becomes intractable fast.  A smarter language
asks: *how many particles are in each available state?*

| Operator | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| $a_i^\dagger$ (**creation**) | adds one particle to site $i$ |
| $a_i$ (**annihilation**) | removes one particle from site $i$ |
| $n_i = a_i^\dagger a_i$ (**number**) | counts particles at site $i$ (0 or 1 for fermions) |

Think of sites as hotel rooms: $a_i^\dagger$ checks a guest into room $i$,
$a_i$ checks them out, and $n_i$ tells the front desk whether the room is
occupied.  For fermions, each room holds **at most one guest**.

### Anticommutation relations (CAR)

The exclusion principle and the swap-sign rule are encoded in three algebraic
identities called the **canonical anticommutation relations** (CAR), where
$\{A,B\} \equiv AB + BA$:

```math
\{a_i,\, a_j^\dagger\} = \delta_{ij}, \qquad
\{a_i,\, a_j\} = 0, \qquad
\{a_i^\dagger,\, a_j^\dagger\} = 0.
```

The first says that at the same site ($i = j$), the two orderings of
create-and-annihilate always add up to the identity:
$a_i a_i^\dagger + a_i^\dagger a_i = 1$.  The second and third say
"swapping the order of two same-type operators flips the sign."
A direct corollary is $(a_i)^2 = 0$: removing a fermion from the same
site twice always gives zero — the operator itself is nilpotent.

In `NCTSSoS.jl`, [`create_fermionic_variables`](@ref) gives you operators
that already obey these rules — every product is automatically simplified
(normal-ordered) by the library.

## The XY spin chain

Now for a concrete physical system.  Picture $N$ tiny magnets (spin-½
particles) arranged on a ring.  Each spin can point "up" ($\uparrow$) or
"down" ($\downarrow$), and neighbouring spins interact.  The **periodic XY
model** describes the interaction:

```math
H_{\mathrm{spin}} = \frac{j_c}{4}\sum_{i=1}^{N}
    \bigl(\sigma^x_i \sigma^x_{i+1} + \sigma^y_i \sigma^y_{i+1}\bigr),
    \qquad \sigma_{N+1} \equiv \sigma_1,
```

where $\sigma^x, \sigma^y$ are Pauli matrices — $2\times 2$ matrices that
encode the spin's quantum state along different axes.  The products
$\sigma^x_i \sigma^x_{i+1}$ and $\sigma^y_i \sigma^y_{i+1}$ describe an
**exchange interaction**: a spin excitation at site $i$ can hop to site
$i{+}1$, and vice versa — like passing a ball around a ring.  The
ground-state energy tells us the minimum energy stored in this ring of
interacting magnets at zero temperature.

The XY model is the canonical test case of many-body quantum physics:
simple enough to solve exactly, yet rich enough to exhibit quantum phase
transitions and long-range entanglement.  If a new numerical method can't
reproduce it, something is wrong.

## Jordan–Wigner transformation — from spins to fermions

Spins on different sites commute (they don't care about each other's
ordering), but fermions on different sites *anticommute* (swapping costs a
sign).  The **Jordan–Wigner transformation** (1928) bridges this gap by
attaching a "parity string" to each site:

```math
a_j = \Bigl(\prod_{k=1}^{j-1} \sigma^z_k\Bigr)\,\sigma^-_j,
```

where $\sigma^-_j = (\sigma^x_j - i\,\sigma^y_j)/2$ is the spin-lowering
operator (it flips a spin from $\uparrow$ to $\downarrow$), and each
$\sigma^z_k$ equals $+1$ or $-1$ depending on the spin state at site
$k$.  The product $\prod_{k<j}\sigma^z_k$ — the **Jordan–Wigner
string** — accumulates a minus sign for every occupied site to the left
of $j$, converting the local (commuting) spin algebra into the nonlocal
(anticommuting) fermion algebra.

**Analogy:** Imagine fermions are people walking single-file in a hallway.
If person $j$ wants to move, they must squeeze past everyone to their left;
each pass costs a sign.  The Jordan–Wigner string is the mathematical
ledger that keeps track of all those sign flips.

### Why nearest-neighbour terms simplify

For adjacent sites $i$ and $i{+}1$, the JW strings almost cancel.
Site $i{+}1$'s string contains every factor of site $i$'s string plus
one extra $\sigma^z_i$.  In the product $a_i^\dagger a_{i+1}$, the
common part squares to identity, leaving
$\sigma^+_i \sigma^z_i \sigma^-_{i+1}$.  A quick matrix check gives
$\sigma^+ \sigma^z = -\sigma^+$, so:

```math
a_i^\dagger a_{i+1} + a_{i+1}^\dagger a_i
  = -\bigl(\sigma^+_i \sigma^-_{i+1} + \sigma^+_{i+1} \sigma^-_i\bigr).
```

Since $\sigma^x_i \sigma^x_{i+1} + \sigma^y_i \sigma^y_{i+1} =
2(\sigma^+_i \sigma^-_{i+1} + \sigma^-_i \sigma^+_{i+1})$, each
interior spin term maps to a simple fermion hop — **no leftover JW
strings**.  The XY Hamiltonian, which looked like an interacting spin
problem, becomes a **free-fermion** Hamiltonian — no interactions
between fermions at all!  That makes it exactly solvable.

## The parity operator — why the boundary term is special

The interior hopping terms translate cleanly, but the **boundary** term
(site $N$ ↔ site $1$, closing the ring) picks up the full-chain parity
string.  This string is exactly the **fermion parity operator**:

```math
P = \prod_{i=1}^{N}(1 - 2\,a_i^\dagger a_i).
```

What does $P$ measure?  Each factor $(1-2n_i)$ equals $+1$ if site $i$ is
empty and $-1$ if occupied.  The product over all sites gives:
- $P = +1$ when the total number of fermions is **even**,
- $P = -1$ when it is **odd**.

$P$ commutes with the Hamiltonian and satisfies $P^2 = I$, so the Hilbert
space splits into two independent **parity sectors**: even ($P=+1$) and
odd ($P=-1$).  The full fermionic Hamiltonian is

```math
H = -\frac{j_c}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}
    \bigl(a_i^\dagger a_{i+1} + a_{i+1}^\dagger a_i\bigr)
  + \frac{j_c}{2}\,P\,
    \bigl(a_N^\dagger a_1 + a_1^\dagger a_N\bigr).
```

### Restricting to the even sector

In the even-parity sector $P = +1$, the boundary factor $P$ becomes just
$+1$, so the Hamiltonian simplifies to a purely quadratic (free) form:

```math
H_{\mathrm{even}} = -\frac{j_c}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}
    \bigl(a_i^\dagger a_{i+1} + a_{i+1}^\dagger a_i\bigr)
  + \frac{j_c}{2}
    \bigl(a_N^\dagger a_1 + a_1^\dagger a_N\bigr).
```

This reduced Hamiltonian already *is* the even-sector problem.  For a very
small system we can additionally certify $P = I$ inside the SDP, but that
parity polynomial has degree $2N$, so it stops fitting inside low-order
relaxations once $N$ grows.

!!! warning "Do not impose `P - I = 0` blindly"
    The polynomial `P - I` has degree `2N`.  For `N = 4`, an order-4
    relaxation can still represent it, so the explicit equality constraint
    works.  For `N = 6` and `N = 8`, the order-3 sparse relaxations used
    below only carry moments up to degree 6, so a model with
    `eq_constraints = [P - I]` is under-supported.

    `NCTSSoS.jl` now rejects that setup instead of silently dropping the
    missing high-degree moments.  So for the larger cases below we solve the
    already-reduced Hamiltonian $H_{\mathrm{even}}$ directly rather than
    adding a separate parity polynomial.

!!! tip "What about the odd-parity sector?"
    In the odd sector ($P = -1$), the boundary sign flips: all hopping
    terms get the *same* sign, giving periodic (not anti-periodic)
    boundary conditions.  For the XY model with $j_c > 0$, the ground
    state lives in the even sector for all chain lengths we consider —
    you can verify this by checking that the number of filled Fermi-sea
    modes is even.  In general, one should solve both sectors and take
    the lower energy.

---

With the physics in place, we can now compute.  We'll first obtain the
**exact** answer analytically (to have something to check against), then
solve the same problem numerically with `NCTSSoS.jl`.

## Exact energy from the free-fermion spectrum

Because $H_{\mathrm{even}}$ is quadratic in the fermion operators, the
problem reduces to diagonalising an $N \times N$ **single-particle
hopping matrix** $h$:

```math
h = -\frac{j_c}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & -1 \\
  1 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 &  0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 &  0 \\
  \vdots & & & \ddots & & \vdots \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 &  1 \\
 -1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 &  0
\end{pmatrix}.
```

The $-1$ entries in the corners (instead of $+1$) are the
**anti-periodic boundary conditions** from the parity twist.  Each
eigenvalue $\varepsilon_k$ of $h$ represents one available energy level.
The ground state is obtained by filling every level with
$\varepsilon_k < 0$ (like stacking blocks into the lowest shelves of a
bookcase).  This filled set of levels is called the **Fermi sea**, and
the ground-state energy is the sum of all negative eigenvalues.

### Method 1 — numerical diagonalisation

end

### Method 2 — analytic Fourier formula

The anti-periodic hopping matrix is diagonalised by a discrete Fourier
transform.  The **half-integer shift** in the momenta comes from the
anti-periodic boundary:

```math
k_n = \frac{2\pi}{N}\Bigl(n + \tfrac{1}{2}\Bigr), \qquad
\varepsilon_n = -j_c \cos(k_n), \qquad n = 0, 1, \ldots, N{-}1.
```

**Worked example for $N = 4$.**  The momenta are
$k_n = \frac{\pi}{4}(2n+1)$ for $n = 0,1,2,3$:

| $n$ | $k_n$     | $\varepsilon_n = -\cos(k_n)$ |
|:---:|:---------:|:----------------------------:|
| 0   | $\pi/4$   | $-1/\sqrt{2} \approx -0.707$ |
| 1   | $3\pi/4$  | $+1/\sqrt{2} \approx +0.707$ |
| 2   | $5\pi/4$  | $+1/\sqrt{2} \approx +0.707$ |
| 3   | $7\pi/4$  | $-1/\sqrt{2} \approx -0.707$ |

Two eigenvalues are negative ($n = 0$ and $n = 3$).  Filling those two
modes — an **even** number, consistent with the even-parity sector —
gives $E_0 = -2/\sqrt{2} = -\sqrt{2} \approx -1.414$.

## Solving with NCTSSoS.jl

Now we solve the *same* problem using **semidefinite programming (SDP)**
relaxations, without knowing the exact answer.

The core idea: diagonalising the full quantum Hamiltonian scales
exponentially in the number of sites, but we can ask a different,
tractable question.  An SDP solver searches for the *lowest* value of
$\langle H \rangle$ that is consistent with the CAR, the chosen
even-sector Hamiltonian, and the requirement that expectation values come
from a valid quantum state.  Because every valid quantum state satisfies
those conditions, the SDP answer is guaranteed to be **at or below** the
true ground-state energy — it is a **certified lower bound**.

!!! note "SDP Solver"
    These examples use [Mosek](https://www.mosek.com/) via `MosekTools`.
    Any SDP-capable solver works: replace `Mosek.Optimizer` with
    `COSMO.Optimizer` or `Clarabel.Optimizer` for open-source alternatives.

````julia
using NCTSSoS, MosekTools, JuMP

    "MSK_IPAR_LOG" => 0,                               # quiet output

````

-------------------------------------------------------------------
## Case 1 — N = 4 (tight at first iteration)

For $N = 4$ the parity polynomial has degree $2N = 8$.  At **order 4**
the moment matrix includes monomials up to degree 8, which covers the
full fermionic Fock space, and the parity constraint is enforced.
A single call to [`cs_nctssos`](@ref) is sufficient.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 1 — Create fermionic variables

[`create_fermionic_variables`](@ref) returns a registry and two vectors:
annihilation operators `a[i]` and creation operators `a_dag[i]`.
All CAR relations are encoded automatically — you never need to manually
specify $\{a_i, a_j^\dagger\} = \delta_{ij}$.

````julia
N₁ = 4
j_c = 1.0
registry₁, (a₁, a₁_dag) = create_fermionic_variables(1:N₁)

````

### Step 2 — Build the even-parity Hamiltonian

We write $H_{\mathrm{even}}$ directly in terms of the fermionic operators.
Each term $a_i^\dagger a_{i+1}$ describes a fermion hopping from site
$i{+}1$ to site $i$.  Notice the **sign flip** on the boundary term
($+j_c/2$ instead of $-j_c/2$): this is the anti-periodic boundary
condition imposed by the even-parity sector.

````julia
ham₁ = sum(
    -ComplexF64(j_c / 2) * (a₁_dag[i] * a₁[i+1] + a₁_dag[i+1] * a₁[i])

````

### Step 3 — Parity constraint: $P - I = 0$

We build $P = \prod_{i=1}^{N}(1 - 2\,a_i^\dagger a_i)$ and impose
$P = I$ as an equality constraint.  Each factor $(1-2n_i)$ maps site $i$
to $+1$ (empty) or $-1$ (occupied); the product is $+1$ exactly when the
total particle number is even.

### Step 4 — Solve the SDP relaxation

[`polyopt`](@ref) packages the Hamiltonian and constraints into a
polynomial optimisation problem.  [`cs_nctssos`](@ref) builds and solves
the SDP relaxation, exploiting sparsity.  The `order` parameter controls
the size of the moment matrix (higher = tighter but costlier).

````julia

````

The SDP bound matches the exact energy to many digits — the relaxation
is **tight** for this small system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
## Scaling up: N = 6 and N = 8

For larger systems, one SDP iteration may produce a loose bound.  Why?
The solver exploits **term sparsity** to break the (exponentially large)
moment matrix into smaller blocks.  Some cross-correlations between
distant sites can be missed in the first decomposition.

There is also a modeling detail that matters here: for `N = 6` and `N = 8`,
the explicit parity polynomial has degree 12 and 16, so the order-3 sparse
relaxation below cannot support it as an `eq_constraint`.  That was exactly
what broke the old page.  We therefore keep the same reduced Hamiltonian
$H_{\mathrm{even}}$, but we do **not** add `P - I = 0` again for these
larger cases.

A second call to [`cs_nctssos_higher`](@ref) reads the moment values from
the first solve, discovers which cross-correlations matter, and refines
the sparsity pattern.  The result is typically tight.

run one round of `cs_nctssos` and one of `cs_nctssos_higher`,
and return `(first_obj, refined_obj, exact)`.

For `N ≥ 6` we intentionally do **not** add `P - I = 0` as an explicit
`eq_constraint`: that degree-`2N` polynomial does not fit inside the low-order
sparse relaxation used here.

## Results

| ``N`` | Exact ``E_0``             | First iteration | After `cs_nctssos_higher` |
|:-----:|:-------------------------:|:---------------:|:-------------------------:|
| 4     | ``-\sqrt{2} \approx -1.414``  | tight       | —                         |
| 6     | ``-\sqrt{3} \approx -1.732``  | loose       | tight                     |
| 8     | ``\approx -2.613``            | loose       | tight                     |

For $N = 4$ the first SDP iteration already matches the exact energy.
For $N = 6$ and $N = 8$, the sparsity-refined second iteration
([`cs_nctssos_higher`](@ref)) tightens the bound to the exact value.

## Summary

### The physics in one paragraph

We started with $N$ interacting spins on a ring (the XY model).  The
Jordan–Wigner transformation rewrote the problem in terms of fermions —
particles that obey anticommutation rules enforced automatically by
`NCTSSoS.jl`.  The boundary term of the ring acquired a parity operator
$P$ that measures whether the total fermion count is even or odd.
Restricting to the even sector fixes the boundary sign and turns the
Hamiltonian into a free-fermion problem whose ground-state energy we can
check exactly.  For `N = 4` we also enforce `P = I` explicitly; for
`N = 6` and `N = 8` we keep the already-reduced Hamiltonian and avoid the
high-degree parity polynomial that would break the low-order sparse
relaxation.  In every case the SDP matches the exact answer, certifying a
rigorous lower bound.

### The code recipe

| Step | What we did | API |
|------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | Create fermionic operators (CAR built in) | [`create_fermionic_variables`](@ref) |
| 2 | Write the even-sector Hamiltonian | standard Julia arithmetic on operators |
| 3 | Keep the large-`N` model low-degree by solving $H_{\mathrm{even}}$ directly (the `N = 4` sanity check also enforces `P = I`) | [`polyopt`](@ref) |
| 4 | Solve & refine the SDP relaxation | [`cs_nctssos`](@ref), [`cs_nctssos_higher`](@ref) |
| 5 | Compare with exact free-fermion energy | `xy_exact_energy` (above) |

### Spin–fermion dictionary

The Jordan–Wigner transformation sets up a one-to-one correspondence
between spin and fermion languages.  This table collects every identity
used above:

| Identity | Spin form | Fermion form |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Raising / lowering | $\sigma^\pm = (\sigma^x \pm i\sigma^y)/2$ | $a_j = (\prod_{k<j}\sigma^z_k)\,\sigma^-_j$ |
| Nilpotency | $(\sigma^\pm)^2 = 0$ | $(a_j)^2 = 0,\; (a_j^\dagger)^2 = 0$ |
| Number operator | $n_j = \sigma^+_j\sigma^-_j = (1+\sigma^z_j)/2$ | $n_j = a_j^\dagger a_j$ |
| CAR (same site) | $\sigma^+\sigma^- + \sigma^-\sigma^+ = 1$ | $\{a_j, a_j^\dagger\} = 1$ |
| Parity per site | $1 - 2\sigma^+_j\sigma^-_j = -\sigma^z_j$ | $1 - 2n_j$ |
| Full parity ($N$ even) | $P = \prod_j \sigma^z_j$ | $P = \prod_j(1 - 2n_j)$ |
| Nearest-neighbour hop | $\sigma^+_i\sigma^-_{i+1} + \text{h.c.}$ | $-(a_i^\dagger a_{i+1} + \text{h.c.})$ |

### Key physical concepts

| Concept | One-liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **Fermion** | Particle that obeys the Pauli exclusion principle (at most one per state) |
| **Creation / annihilation** | Operators $a_i^\dagger, a_i$ that add / remove a fermion at site $i$ |
| **CAR** | $\{a_i, a_j^\dagger\}=\delta_{ij}$ — the algebraic encoding of exclusion + swap sign |
| **Jordan–Wigner** | Exact mapping from spin operators to fermion operators via a parity string |
| **Parity operator** $P$ | $\prod_i(1-2n_i)$: $+1$ for even total particle count, $-1$ for odd |
| **Ground-state energy** | Lowest eigenvalue of $H$ — the energy at absolute zero |

### When to use the fermionic interface

- Models that are naturally quadratic (or low-degree) in fermion operators
- Jordan–Wigner reductions of spin chains
- Problems where parity or particle-number sectors must be fixed
