# [Kitaev Chain (Topological Superconductor)](@id kitaev-chain)

This example computes **certified lower bounds** on the ground-state energy
of the **Kitaev chain** — the simplest model that hosts a *topological*
superconducting phase with **Majorana zero modes** at its ends.

If you haven't seen fermionic operators before, start with the
[Fermionic Ground State (XY Model)](@ref fermionic-ground-state) example,
which builds the language of creation/annihilation operators and the CAR
from scratch.  Here we assume that background and focus on what's new:
**pairing terms** that break particle-number conservation, **Majorana
operators**, the **topological vs. trivial phase**, and the difference
between **open** and **periodic** boundary conditions.

## The Kitaev chain Hamiltonian

Picture $N$ sites on an open wire (no ring).  Each site can hold zero or
one spinless fermion.  The Hamiltonian has three terms:

```math
H = -\mu \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i^\dagger a_i
    \;-\; t \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\bigl(a_i^\dagger a_{i+1} + a_{i+1}^\dagger a_i\bigr)
    \;+\; \Delta \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\bigl(a_i\, a_{i+1} + a_{i+1}^\dagger a_i^\dagger\bigr).
```

| Term | Physics | Effect on particle number |
|:-----|:--------|:-------------------------|
| $-\mu\, a_i^\dagger a_i$ | **Chemical potential** — energy cost of occupying a site | Conserves $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$ |
| $-t\,(a_i^\dagger a_{i+1} + \text{h.c.})$ | **Hopping** — fermion tunnels between neighbours | Conserves $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$ |
| $\Delta\,(a_i\, a_{i+1} + \text{h.c.})$ | **Pairing** — creates or destroys fermion *pairs* from a condensate | **Breaks** $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$ conservation |

The pairing term is the key novelty compared to the XY model.  It models
a *p-wave* superconductor: the pairing amplitude connects neighbouring
sites (odd under spatial inversion in momentum space).  Because pairs of
fermions are created and destroyed, particle number $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$
is no longer conserved.  What *is* conserved is **fermionic parity**:
$P = (-1)^{N_{\mathrm{tot}}}$.  Every term in $H$ changes the fermion
count by $0$ or $\pm 2$, so even/odd parity never flips.

!!! note "Open boundary conditions — no parity constraint needed"
    The [XY model example](@ref fermionic-ground-state) uses **periodic**
    boundaries (a ring), where the boundary term picks up a parity
    operator $P$ and we must impose $P = I$ as a constraint.  Here we
    use **open** boundaries (a wire) — there is no boundary twist, so
    no parity constraint is required.  The SDP relaxation searches
    over all parity sectors automatically.

## Majorana operators and the topological sweet spot

Every complex fermion can be split into two **Majorana** (real) fermions:

```math
c_{2j-1} = a_j + a_j^\dagger, \qquad
c_{2j} = \frac{a_j - a_j^\dagger}{i}.
```

These are self-conjugate ($c_l^\dagger = c_l$) and obey
$\{c_l, c_m\} = 2\delta_{lm}$.  Think of them as splitting a complex
number into its real and imaginary parts — except the "parts" are
operators that anticommute.

### The sweet spot: $\mu = 0$, $t = \Delta$

Set $\mu = 0$ and $t = \Delta$.  The Hamiltonian simplifies to:

```math
H = it \sum_{j=1}^{N-1} c_{2j}\, c_{2j+1}.
```

Each term pairs the Majorana $c_{2j}$ from site $j$ with $c_{2j+1}$ from
site $j{+}1$ — the pairing reaches **across** sites.  But the first
Majorana $c_1$ and the last $c_{2N}$ appear in *no* term of $H$: they
are the **unpaired Majorana zero modes**.  Any operator that commutes
with $H$ and is built from $c_1$ and $c_{2N}$ alone costs zero energy —
hence "zero mode."  These edge modes are the hallmark of the topological
phase.

Under the Jordan–Wigner transformation, $ic_{2j}\,c_{2j+1} = X_j X_{j+1}$,
so the sweet-spot Hamiltonian maps to the open **XX chain**:

```math
H_{\text{sweet}} = \sum_{j=1}^{N-1} X_j X_{j+1},
\qquad E_0 = -(N-1).
```

We'll verify this Majorana↔Pauli connection explicitly in the
[bonus section](#Bonus:-Sweet-spot-via-PauliAlgebra) below.

## Exact diagonalisation oracle

To check our SDP bounds we need an exact answer.  We build the full
$2^N \times 2^N$ Hamiltonian matrix via the **Jordan–Wigner** mapping
(fermion operators → tensor products of Pauli matrices) and take the
smallest eigenvalue.  This is brute-force exact diagonalisation — it
works for small $N$ and serves as our verification oracle.

Quick sanity check — the sweet spot should give $E_0 = -(N-1)$:

````julia

    E = kitaev_chain_exact(N; μ = 0.0, t = 1.0, Δ = 1.0)

## Solving with NCTSSoS.jl

We now reproduce these exact values using **semidefinite programming**
relaxations.  The solver doesn't know the answer — it searches for the
lowest expectation value of $H$ consistent with the fermionic algebra
(CAR).  The result is a **certified lower bound** on the true $E_0$.

!!! note "SDP Solver"
    These examples use [Mosek](https://www.mosek.com/) via `MosekTools`.
    Any SDP-capable solver works: replace `Mosek.Optimizer` with
    `COSMO.Optimizer` or `Clarabel.Optimizer` for open-source alternatives.

## Case 1 — Sweet spot ($\mu = 0$, $t = \Delta = 1$)

At the sweet spot, all Majorana pairs across bonds are occupied and the
ground-state energy is $E_0 = -(N-1)$.  This is the deep topological phase.

Tight at **order 1** — the SDP relaxation captures the full ground state
for this small system.

---
## Case 2 — Trivial phase ($\mu = 3$, $t = 1$, $\Delta = 1$)

When $|\mu| > 2|t|$ the chemical potential dominates and the system enters
the **trivial** phase — no Majorana zero modes, no topological protection.
The gap doesn't close; the chain is a boring band insulator.

## Case 3 — Asymmetric pairing ($\mu = 0$, $t = 1$, $\Delta = 0.5$)

With $\Delta \neq t$ but still $|\mu| < 2|t|$, we remain in the
topological phase.  The ground-state energy interpolates between
the sweet spot ($\Delta = t$, maximal gap) and the tight-binding
limit ($\Delta = 0$, no superconductivity).

---
## Case 4 — Pure hopping ($\mu = 0$, $t = 1$, $\Delta = 0$)

With no pairing at all, the Hamiltonian is a standard **tight-binding**
chain — free fermions hopping on a wire.  The ground-state energy for
$N = 4$ is $E_0 = -\sqrt{5}$.  No superconductivity, no topology;
this is the trivial metal limit.

## Results summary

| Case | $\mu$ | $t$ | $\Delta$ | Phase | Exact $E_0$ | SDP bound |
|:-----|:-----:|:---:|:--------:|:------|:------------|:----------|
| 1 — Sweet spot | 0 | 1 | 1 | Topological | $-3$ | tight |
| 2 — Trivial    | 3 | 1 | 1 | Trivial     | $\approx -12.504$ | tight |
| 3 — Asymmetric | 0 | 1 | 0.5 | Topological | $\approx -2.422$ | tight |
| 4 — Hopping    | 0 | 1 | 0 | Trivial (metal) | $-\sqrt{5} \approx -2.236$ | tight |

All four cases converge at **order 1** — the Kitaev chain with open
boundaries and $N = 4$ sites is small enough for the first relaxation to
capture the full ground state.

---

## Phase diagram

The Kitaev chain has a sharp **topological phase transition** controlled
by the ratio $|\mu|/(2|t|)$:

| Regime | Phase | Edge modes? |
|:-------|:------|:------------|
| $|\mu| < 2|t|$, $\Delta \neq 0$ | **Topological** | Yes — unpaired Majorana zero modes at each end |
| $|\mu| > 2|t|$ | **Trivial** | No |
| $|\mu| = 2|t|$ | **Critical** | Gap closes — phase transition |
| $\Delta = 0$ (any $\mu$, $t$) | **Trivial (metal)** | No — no superconductivity at all |

Our four cases sample each regime.  Case 1 sits at the sweet spot deep
in the topological phase; Case 2 is well into the trivial phase;
Case 3 is topological but not at the sweet spot; Case 4 has no pairing,
so no superconductivity and no topology.

!!! tip "Why topological matters"
    In the topological phase, the two Majorana zero modes ($c_1$ and
    $c_{2N}$) encode a single fermionic degree of freedom that is
    *delocalised* across the entire chain.  This nonlocal storage makes
    the qubit robust against local perturbations — the foundation of
    proposals for **topological quantum computing** with Majorana-based
    qubits.

---

## Bonus: Sweet-spot via PauliAlgebra

We showed above that at $\mu = 0$, $t = \Delta$, the Majorana form of
the Kitaev chain maps under Jordan–Wigner to the open XX chain:
$H = \sum_{j=1}^{N-1} X_j X_{j+1}$.  Let's verify this directly using
the [`create_pauli_variables`](@ref) interface.

````julia
N₅ = 4
registry₅, (x₅, _, _) = create_pauli_variables(1:N₅)

ham₅ = sum(1.0 * x₅[i] * x₅[i+1] for i in 1:(N₅ - 1))

pop₅ = polyopt(ham₅, registry₅)
config₅ = SolverConfig(optimizer = SOLVER, order = 1)
result₅ = cs_nctssos(pop₅, config₅)

println("Pauli XX chain:  SDP = $(result₅.objective),  fermionic sweet spot = $exact₁")
````

````
Pauli XX chain:  SDP = -3.0000000040682764,  fermionic sweet spot = -3.0000000000000004

````

Same answer — $E_0 = -3$.  The Pauli and fermionic interfaces are two
windows onto the same physics.  Use whichever is more natural for your
model.

## Summary

### The physics in one paragraph

The Kitaev chain is a 1D chain of spinless fermions with nearest-neighbour
hopping and *p*-wave pairing.  The pairing term breaks particle-number
conservation but preserves fermionic parity.  When $|\mu| < 2|t|$ and
$\Delta \neq 0$, the chain is in a **topological superconducting phase**
with unpaired Majorana zero modes at its ends.  At the sweet spot
($\mu = 0$, $t = \Delta$), the Majorana representation makes the physics
transparent: the Hamiltonian pairs Majoranas across bonds, leaving two
dangling zero modes.  Our SDP relaxation reproduces the exact
ground-state energy across all four parameter regimes.

### The code recipe

| Step | What we did | API |
|:-----|:------------|:----|
| 1 | Create fermionic operators (CAR built in) | [`create_fermionic_variables`](@ref) |
| 2 | Write the Kitaev chain Hamiltonian (hopping + pairing + chemical potential) | standard Julia arithmetic |
| 3 | Solve the SDP relaxation (no parity constraint — open BCs) | [`polyopt`](@ref), [`cs_nctssos`](@ref) |
| 4 | Verify against exact diagonalisation | `kitaev_chain_exact` (above) |
| 5 | Cross-check sweet spot via Pauli XX chain | [`create_pauli_variables`](@ref) |

### Key concepts

| Concept | One-liner |
|:--------|:----------|
| **Kitaev chain** | 1D *p*-wave superconductor: hopping + pairing on an open wire |
| **Pairing term** | $\Delta(a_i a_{i+1} + \text{h.c.})$ — creates/destroys fermion pairs, breaks $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$ conservation |
| **Fermionic parity** | $P = (-1)^{N_{\mathrm{tot}}}$ — conserved even when particle number is not |
| **Majorana operator** | $c = a + a^\dagger$ (self-conjugate, real fermion); two per site |
| **Sweet spot** | $\mu = 0$, $t = \Delta$: Majoranas pair across bonds, zero modes appear |
| **Topological phase** | $|\mu| < 2|t|$, $\Delta \neq 0$: unpaired Majorana edge modes |
| **Trivial phase** | $|\mu| > 2|t|$: no edge modes, ordinary insulator/metal |

### Fermionic vs. Pauli: when to use which

| Use case | Interface |
|:---------|:----------|
| Model written in $a$, $a^\dagger$ (Kitaev chain, Hubbard, BCS) | [`create_fermionic_variables`](@ref) |
| Model written in Pauli $X$, $Y$, $Z$ (Heisenberg, Ising, XX) | [`create_pauli_variables`](@ref) |
| Sweet-spot check / Jordan–Wigner cross-validation | Both — compare results |
