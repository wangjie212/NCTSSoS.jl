# [Obtaining Ground State Energy Lower Bound](@id ground-state-energy)

Finding the ground state of a quantum system is a fundamental problem in quantum
mechanics [wang2024Certifying](@cite). Variational methods are commonly used to
approximate the ground state. Due to the variational nature of these methods,
only an upper bound can be obtained [kull2024Lower](@cite). Polynomial
optimization techniques provides a way to find the lower bound of the ground
state energy.

In general, we consider the following Hamiltonian:
```math
H = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{i \lt j} J_{ij} \sum_{a \in \{x,y,z\}} \sigma_i^a \sigma_j^a
```

## 1D Heisenberg Model with Nearest Neighbor Interaction

Firstly, let's consider the simplest case of 1D Heisenberg chain with nearest
neighbor interaction and periodic boundary condition.

!!! note "SDP Solver"
    These examples use [Mosek](https://www.mosek.com/) via `MosekTools`.
    Any SDP-capable solver works: replace `Mosek.Optimizer` with
    `COSMO.Optimizer` or `Clarabel.Optimizer` for open-source alternatives.

````julia
using NCTSSoS, MosekTools
N = 6

Create Pauli variables using the typed algebra system
This automatically encodes all Pauli commutation relations

````julia
registry, (σx, σy, σz) = create_pauli_variables(1:N)

ham = sum(ComplexF64(1 / 4) * op[i] * op[mod1(i + 1, N)] for op in [σx, σy, σz] for i in 1:N)
````

````
0.25 + 0.0im * σx₁σx₂ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σx₁σx₆ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σy₁σy₂ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σy₁σy₆ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σz₁σz₂ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σz₁σz₆ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σx₂σx₃ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σy₂σy₃ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σz₂σz₃ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σx₃σx₄ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σy₃σy₄ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σz₃σz₄ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σx₄σx₅ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σy₄σy₅ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σz₄σz₅ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σx₅σx₆ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σy₅σy₆ + 0.25 + 0.0im * σz₅σz₆
````

No need to manually specify constraints - they're encoded in the algebra type!

````julia
pop = polyopt(ham, registry)

solver_config = SolverConfig(
                    optimizer=Mosek.Optimizer,          # the solver backend
                    order=3,                            # moment matrix order
                    ts_algo=MMD(),                      # term sparsity algorithm
                    )

res = cs_nctssos(pop, solver_config)
res.objective / N
````

````
-0.46712927394112297
````

For this small $N = 6$ instance, the sparse order-$3$ lower bound is already
tight. The returned value agrees with the reference ground-state energy per
site $-0.467129$ reported in [wang2024Certifying](@cite).

## 1D Heisenberg Model with next nearest neighbor interaction

Polynomial Optimization framework is quite general. Almost no modification is
required to handle more complex Hamiltonian. 1D Heisenberg Model with geometric
frustration induced by next nearest neighbor interaction can be solved as:

````julia
using NCTSSoS, MosekTools
N = 6
J1 = 1.0                            # Nearest Neighbor Interaction
J2 = 0.2                            # Next Nearest Neighbor Interaction

registry, (σx, σy, σz) = create_pauli_variables(1:N)

ham = sum(ComplexF64(J1 / 4) * op[i] * op[mod1(i + 1, N)] + ComplexF64(J2 / 4) * op[i] * op[mod1(i + 2, N)] for op in [σx, σy, σz] for i in 1:N)

pop = polyopt(ham, registry)

solver_config = SolverConfig(optimizer=Mosek.Optimizer, order=3, ts_algo=MMD())

res = cs_nctssos(pop, solver_config)
res.objective / N
````

````
-0.4270083243443415
````

Again, for this small $N = 6$ instance the sparse order-$3$ lower bound is
already tight. The returned value agrees with the reference ground-state
energy per site $-0.4270083225302217$ reported in [wang2024Certifying](@cite).

## 2D Square Lattice

Extending Heisenberg model to $2$-D case is also straightforward. However `NCTSSoS.jl` is not efficient enough to handle system at this size.

````julia
using NCTSSoS, MosekTools
Nx = 3
Ny = 3
N = Nx * Ny
J1 = 1.0
J2 = 0.0

registry, (σx, σy, σz) = create_pauli_variables(1:N)

LI = LinearIndices((1:Nx, 1:Ny))

ham = sum(ComplexF64(J1 / 4) * op[LI[CartesianIndex(i, j)]] * op[LI[CartesianIndex(i, mod1(j + 1, Ny))]] + ComplexF64(J1 / 4) * op[LI[CartesianIndex(i, j)]] * op[LI[CartesianIndex(mod1(i + 1, Nx), j)]] + ComplexF64(J2 / 4) * op[LI[CartesianIndex(i, j)]] * op[LI[CartesianIndex(mod1(i + 1, Nx), mod1(j + 1, Ny))]] + ComplexF64(J2 / 4) * op[LI[CartesianIndex(i, j)]] * op[LI[CartesianIndex(mod1(i + 1, Nx), mod1(j - 1, Ny))]] for op in [σx, σy, σz] for i in 1:Nx for j in 1:Ny)

pop = polyopt(ham, registry)

solver_config = SolverConfig(optimizer=Mosek.Optimizer, order=3, cs_algo=MF(), ts_algo=MMD())
````

````
NCTSSoS.SolverConfig(Mosek.Optimizer, 3, nothing, CliqueTrees.MF(), CliqueTrees.MMD(0), nothing)
````

## Next step

With such lower bounds, estimates of properties of the ground
state, correlations functions, structure factors and order parameters, can also
be obtained. We provide examples in another [section](@ref certify-property).
