# # [Hubbard Model (Canonical Particle-Number Constraints)](@id hubbard-model)
#
# This example computes **certified lower bounds** on the ground-state energy
# of the **1D Hubbard model** — the hydrogen atom of strongly correlated
# electron systems.  We solve the problem two ways:
#
# 1. **Grand-canonical** — no particle-number constraint (optimise over the
#    entire Fock space).
# 2. **Canonical** — fix the number of spin-up and spin-down electrons
#    (half-filling).
#
# The canonical case uses [`particle_number_constraint`](@ref), which builds
# the right `moment_eq_constraints` for fixed particle-number sectors.  The
# difference between the two cases teaches a key lesson about **state
# constraints vs. operator identities** in SDP relaxations.
#
# If you haven't seen fermionic operators before, start with the
# [Fermionic Ground State (XY Model)](@ref fermionic-ground-state) example,
# which builds creation/annihilation operators and the CAR from scratch.
# Here we assume that background and focus on what's new: **spin degrees of
# freedom**, **doubled fermionic modes**, and **moment equality constraints**
# for fixing particle number.

#
# ## The 1D Hubbard Hamiltonian
#
# Picture $N$ sites on a ring.  Each site can hold up to **two** electrons —
# one spin-up ($\uparrow$) and one spin-down ($\downarrow$).  The
# Hamiltonian has two competing terms:
#
# ```math
# H = -t \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle, \sigma}
#     \bigl(c_{i\sigma}^\dagger c_{j\sigma} + \text{h.c.}\bigr)
#     \;+\; U \sum_{i=1}^{N} n_{i\uparrow}\, n_{i\downarrow},
# ```
#
# where $n_{i\sigma} = c_{i\sigma}^\dagger c_{i\sigma}$ counts electrons of
# spin $\sigma$ at site $i$, and $\langle i,j \rangle$ runs over
# nearest-neighbour pairs on the ring.
#
# | Term | Physics | Favours |
# |:-----|:--------|:--------|
# | $-t\,(c_{i\sigma}^\dagger c_{j\sigma} + \text{h.c.})$ | **Hopping** — kinetic energy, electron tunnels between neighbours | Delocalisation (metallic) |
# | $U\, n_{i\uparrow}\, n_{i\downarrow}$ | **On-site repulsion** — Coulomb energy when two electrons share a site | Localisation (insulating) |
#
# The ground-state physics is controlled by the ratio $U/t$:
# - **Small $U/t$**: electrons delocalise freely — a metal.
# - **Large $U/t$**: double occupancy is too costly — electrons freeze
#   in place, forming a **Mott insulator**.
# - At **half-filling** (one electron per site on average) and large
#   $U/t$, virtual hopping generates an effective antiferromagnetic
#   exchange $J \sim 4t^2/U$ — the **Heisenberg limit**.

# ---
#
# ## Spin and doubled fermionic modes
#
# Each physical site holds **two** fermionic modes (spin-up and spin-down).
# In `NCTSSoS.jl` we represent both species in **one** fermionic algebra
# on **disjoint mode ranges**:
#
# | Mode index | Physical meaning |
# |:-----------|:-----------------|
# | $1, 2, \ldots, N$ | Spin-up: $c_{1\uparrow}, c_{2\uparrow}, \ldots, c_{N\uparrow}$ |
# | $N{+}1, N{+}2, \ldots, 2N$ | Spin-down: $c_{1\downarrow}, c_{2\downarrow}, \ldots, c_{N\downarrow}$ |
#
# Because all $2N$ modes share one algebra, they **all anticommute** with
# each other — including cross-species:
# $\{c_{i\uparrow},\, c_{j\downarrow}^\dagger\} = 0$, exactly as
# required by the full fermionic CAR.  The "disjoint" part refers only to
# the mode *indices*, not to the algebra.
#
# Why not use a single mode per site?  Because the on-site repulsion
# $n_{i\uparrow}\, n_{i\downarrow} = (c_{i\uparrow}^\dagger c_{i\uparrow})(c_{i\downarrow}^\dagger c_{i\downarrow})$
# involves **four** operators on **distinct** mode indices — it is
# genuinely **quartic**.  If up and down shared the same mode index, this
# product would collapse via $n_i^2 = n_i$ and we'd lose the two-body
# physics entirely.

# ---
#
# ## Grand-canonical vs. canonical
#
# | Ensemble | Constraint | Optimises over |
# |:---------|:-----------|:---------------|
# | **Grand-canonical** | None on particle number | Entire Fock space ($4^N$ states) |
# | **Canonical** | $N_\uparrow, N_\downarrow$ fixed | Single particle-number sector |
#
# The grand-canonical ground state may live in a **different**
# particle-number sector than the one of physical interest.  For
# our $N = 4$ ring with $U/t = 4$, the global ground state has
# $E_0 \approx -3.419$ in the dilute sector $(N_\uparrow, N_\downarrow) = (1, 1)$,
# while the half-filled sector $(N_\uparrow = N_\downarrow = 2)$ has
# $E_0 \approx -2.103$.  If you care about the half-filled Mott physics,
# you **must** constrain the particle number.
#
# !!! tip "When to use canonical constraints"
#     Real experiments almost always fix the electron count — electrons
#     don't appear or disappear in a solid.  Use canonical constraints
#     whenever you know which particle-number sector the physics lives in.

# This quartic Hubbard example is a good reminder that sparsity is not magic.
# Plain order-2 dense relaxations leave visible gaps, while dense order 3 is
# essentially exact but much slower.  The practical compromise here is to use

#
# ## Why canonical constraints need special treatment
#
# To restrict to half-filling, we want to impose
# $(\hat{N}_\uparrow - 2)|\psi\rangle = 0$ and
# $(\hat{N}_\downarrow - 2)|\psi\rangle = 0$.  This looks like an
# equality constraint, so you might reach for `eq_constraints`.
# **That would be wrong.**  Here's why.
#
# !!! warning "`eq_constraints` vs. `moment_eq_constraints`"
#     [`polyopt`](@ref) offers two kinds of equality constraint:
#
#     **`eq_constraints`** treats ``g = 0`` as an **operator identity** —
#     true in *every* quantum state.  Internally it builds a full bilinear
#     localizing matrix, imposing
#     $\langle b_i^\dagger \, g \, b_j \rangle = 0$ for all basis pairs
#     $(b_i, b_j)$.  Use this for identities like the CAR or $P^2 = I$.
#     Do **not** use it for sector-fixing conditions such as
#     $P|\psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle$.
#
#     **`moment_eq_constraints`** treats ``g|\psi\rangle = 0`` as a **state
#     constraint** — true for the *target state*, not universally.  It
#     builds the one-sided localizing form
#     $\langle b_i^\dagger \, g \rangle = 0$ for each basis element $b_i$.
#
#     The difference matters when $g$ changes particle number.  The
#     bilinear form $\langle b_i^\dagger \, g \, b_j \rangle = 0$
#     constrains matrix elements **between different particle-number
#     sectors** — elements that the true state never connects.  This
#     overconstrains the SDP and produces garbage (for these parameters,
#     objective $\approx +2$ instead of $\approx -2$).
#
#     **Rule of thumb:** if ``g = 0`` is a law of the algebra (holds for
#     every state), use `eq_constraints`.  If ``g|\psi\rangle = 0`` is a
#     property of the state you're looking for, use
#     `moment_eq_constraints`.

# ---
#
# ## Case 2 — Canonical half-filling ($N_\uparrow = N_\downarrow = 2$)
#
# We impose half-filling with one helper call.  Each group is a vector of
# annihilation operators, so `c_up => 2` means
# ``\sum_i c_{i\uparrow}^\dagger c_{i\uparrow} = 2`` and similarly for
# spin down.

canonical_constraints = particle_number_constraint(registry, c_up => 2, c_dn => 2)

pop_can = polyopt(ham, registry; moment_eq_constraints = canonical_constraints)

println("Gap after refinement:                     $(round(abs(result_can.objective - E_half); digits=6))")

# The helper expands to the same one-sided constraints you would write by
# hand, but without exposing that plumbing in every model.  The canonical
# bound tracks the half-filled sector — it is *not* pulled down to the lower
# full-Fock minimum.  At order 4, one refinement step drives the gap down to
# about ${\sim}10^{-7}$.

# ---
#
# ## Results
#
# | Quantity | Value |
# |:--------|------:|
# | Exact full-Fock $E_0$ | $-3.419$ |
# | Grand-canonical SDP (order 3 TS + higher) | $\approx -3.419$ |
# | Exact half-filled $E_0\;(N_\uparrow{=}N_\downarrow{=}2)$ | $-2.103$ |
# | Canonical SDP (order 4 TS + higher) | $\approx -2.103$ |
#
# Both SDP values are **valid lower bounds** on their respective exact
# energies.  For this example, the practical sweet spot is not plain dense
# order 2, and it is not naive correlative sparsity either.  Using **term
# sparsity plus one refinement step**, the grand-canonical case is already
# essentially exact at order 3, while the canonical case reaches numerical
# precision at order 4.

#
# ## Summary
#
# ### The physics in one paragraph
#
# The 1D Hubbard model captures the competition between electron hopping
# ($t$) and on-site Coulomb repulsion ($U$).  We solved $N = 4$ sites on a
# periodic ring at $U/t = 4$ — firmly in the correlated regime — both
# without and with particle-number constraints.  The grand-canonical SDP
# finds a lower bound across all Fock sectors; the canonical relaxation,
# using `particle_number_constraint(registry, c_up => 2, c_dn => 2)` to fix
# $N_\uparrow = N_\downarrow = 2$, targets the half-filled Mott sector
# specifically.  Numerically, this is a case where **term sparsity plus one
# refinement step** works well, but the
# two sectors are not equally hard: the grand-canonical problem is already
# essentially exact at order 3, while the canonical half-filled problem needs
# order 4 to close the gap to numerical precision.
#
# ### The code recipe
#
# | Step | What we did | API |
# |:-----|:------------|:----|
# | 1 | Create spin-up and spin-down operators on disjoint mode ranges | [`create_fermionic_variables`](@ref) with species list |
# | 2 | Build the Hubbard Hamiltonian (hopping + on-site repulsion) | Standard Julia arithmetic |
# | 3 | Grand-canonical solve with order-3 term sparsity refinement | [`polyopt`](@ref) $\to$ [`cs_nctssos`](@ref) $\to$ [`cs_nctssos_higher`](@ref) |
# | 4 | Canonical solve with fixed particle number, order 4, and one refinement | [`particle_number_constraint`](@ref) in `moment_eq_constraints`, then [`cs_nctssos`](@ref) $\to$ [`cs_nctssos_higher`](@ref) |
# | 5 | Verify against exact diagonalisation | `hubbard_exact_matrix` + `sector_ground_state_energy` |
#
# ### Key concepts
#
# | Concept | One-liner |
# |:--------|:----------|
# | **Hubbard model** | Hopping $t$ vs. on-site repulsion $U$ — simplest model of strongly correlated electrons |
# | **Doubled modes** | Spin-up and spin-down as disjoint mode ranges in one registry ($2N$ modes for $N$ sites) |
# | **Grand-canonical** | No particle-number constraint — optimise over entire Fock space |
# | **Canonical** | Fix $N_\uparrow$ and $N_\downarrow$ — optimise within a single particle-number sector |
# | **`moment_eq_constraints`** | One-sided localizing: $\langle b_i^\dagger g \rangle = 0$ — for state constraints (``g|\psi\rangle = 0``) |
# | **`eq_constraints`** | Full bilinear localizing: $\langle b_i^\dagger g\, b_j \rangle = 0$ — for operator identities (``g = 0`` always) |
# | **Mott insulator** | Large $U/t$ at half-filling: electrons localise, charge transport freezes |
