# # [Pauli Symmetry Reduction: Manual Clifford Gates and Automatic SympleQ Detection](@id pauli-clifford-symmetry)
#
# The cost of a moment relaxation is driven by the size of its PSD blocks: an
# order-2 half-basis on 10 qubits already produces a ``436 \times 436`` moment
# matrix with thousands of distinct moment variables, and interior-point
# solvers pay roughly cubic cost in the block side. Symmetry reduction is one
# of the few reductions that shrinks those blocks **exactly** — the optimum is
# unchanged, unlike sparsity-based relaxations which may weaken the bound.
#
# Using symmetry takes two separate steps, and this page motivates both:
#
# 1. **Exploit.** Given a group that provably leaves the problem invariant,
#    block-diagonalize the moment matrix and merge moment variables into
#    orbits. NCTSSoS does this whenever you pass a [`SymmetrySpec`](@ref); the
#    machinery is described in
#    [Symmetry-Adapted Basis](@ref symmetry-adapted-basis).
# 2. **Find.** Produce that group in the first place — either write
#    [`CliffordSymmetry`](@ref) generators by hand, or let
#    [`sympleq_symmetry_spec`](@ref) detect them from the Hamiltonian
#    automatically (the algorithm is described in
#    [Clifford Symmetry Detection](@ref clifford-symmetry-detection)).
#
# Why bother with automatic detection when a model's symmetry looks obvious?
# Because **the symmetry you can see is usually not all there is** — and the
# two-site Heisenberg model, the smallest example with a known answer, already
# makes the point sharply:
#
# - the symmetry everyone writes down (qubit swap) is a group of order **2**
#   and splits the ``7\times 7`` moment block into sizes ``[4, 3]``;
# - the model's *internal* symmetry — global rotations of the Pauli axes,
#   which fix no individual term of ``H`` — is a group of order **24** that
#   SympleQ finds automatically, collapsing the SDP to blocks ``[1, 2]`` with
#   a *single* nontrivial moment variable;
# - the union of both is a group of order **48** that reduces the whole
#   ``7 \times 7`` PSD constraint to three scalars.
#
# Detection and inspection find *different* parts of the symmetry group, so
# the best spec is their union. We demonstrate this on 2 and 4 sites where
# every number can be checked by hand, then time the payoff on a 10-site ring
# at relaxation order 2.
#
# **Prerequisites:** the [CHSH symmetry](@ref chsh-symmetry) example (the
# same workflow with signed permutations on measurement variables) and the
# [Symmetry-Adapted Basis](@ref symmetry-adapted-basis) manual page (the
# architectural picture).

# ## Step 1 — Build the 2-site Heisenberg model
#
# The isotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian on two qubits is
#
# ```math
# H = \frac{1}{4}\bigl(\sigma_1^x \sigma_2^x
#   + \sigma_1^y \sigma_2^y
#   + \sigma_1^z \sigma_2^z\bigr).
# ```
#
# Its ground-state energy is ``-3/4``. We will certify that lower bound with a
# moment relaxation and then shrink the SDP with progressively more symmetry.

registry, (σx, σy, σz) = create_pauli_variables(1:2);

# Pauli Hamiltonians use `ComplexF64` coefficients (the algebra's phase
# structure needs complex arithmetic internally, even for Hermitian operators):

H = sum(ComplexF64(1 / 4) * op[1] * op[2] for op in (σx, σy, σz))

# Package the Hamiltonian for optimization — the Pauli commutation and
# anticommutation relations are encoded in the algebra type, so no explicit
# constraints are needed:

pop = polyopt(H, registry);

# Fix an explicit order-1 half-basis so every run below uses exactly the same
# monomials. The seven elements are: the identity, plus all single-site Pauli
# operators.

basis = [one(σx[1]), σx[1], σx[2], σy[1], σy[2], σz[1], σz[2]];
length(basis)

# ## Step 2 — Dense baseline (no symmetry)
#
# Without symmetry or sparsity reduction, the moment matrix is a single dense
# block indexed by all seven basis monomials.

dense_config = SolverConfig(
    optimizer    = SILENT_MOSEK,
    moment_basis = basis,
    cs_algo      = NoElimination(),
    ts_algo      = NoElimination(),
)

dense_result = cs_nctssos(pop, dense_config);

# The objective recovers the exact ground-state energy:

dense_result.objective

# Sanity-check against the analytical value:

abs(dense_result.objective - (-0.75))

# The dense layout produces a single `7×7` PSD block:

dense_result.moment_matrix_sizes

# with this many distinct moment variables:

dense_result.n_unique_moment_matrix_elements

# No symmetry was applied, so the report field is empty:

dense_result.symmetry === nothing

# ## Step 3 — The symmetry you can see: qubit SWAP
#
# The 2-site Heisenberg Hamiltonian is invariant under qubit exchange. In Pauli
# language, the SWAP gate conjugates every single-site Pauli operator on qubit 1
# into the corresponding operator on qubit 2, and vice versa:
#
# ```math
# \text{SWAP}\;\sigma_i^a\;\text{SWAP}^\dagger = \sigma_j^a, \quad
# \{i,j\} = \{1,2\},\; a \in \{x,y,z\}.
# ```
#
# Each term ``\sigma_1^a \sigma_2^a`` is symmetric under this exchange, so
# ``H`` is invariant — this is the symmetry anyone spots in five seconds.
#
# [`CliffordSymmetry`](@ref) provides named constructors for the standard
# Clifford gates — `:H` (Hadamard), `:S` (phase), `:CNOT`, and `:SWAP`:

swap = CliffordSymmetry(:SWAP, 1, 2)

# Wrap the generator in a [`SymmetrySpec`](@ref). The package will enumerate
# the full group (here: order 2) and verify that the objective is truly
# invariant before solving:

manual_spec = SymmetrySpec(swap);

# Build a config identical to the dense one, except for the `symmetry` keyword:

manual_config = SolverConfig(
    optimizer    = SILENT_MOSEK,
    moment_basis = basis,
    cs_algo      = NoElimination(),
    ts_algo      = NoElimination(),
    symmetry     = manual_spec,
)

manual_result = cs_nctssos(pop, manual_config);

# Same objective — the symmetry reduction is exact, not an additional relaxation:

manual_result.objective

# Difference from the dense baseline:

abs(manual_result.objective - dense_result.objective)

# ### Reading the [`SymmetryReport`](@ref)
#
# The `symmetry` field now contains a diagnostic summary of what the reduction
# did:

report = manual_result.symmetry

# The SWAP generator generates a group of order 2 (identity + swap):

report.group_order

# The original half-basis had 7 monomials:

(report.basis_half_size, report.basis_full_size)

# The dense `7×7` PSD block has been split into two independent blocks — one
# of size 4 (symmetric subspace) and one of size 3 (antisymmetric subspace):

report.psd_block_sizes

# and the 16 distinct moment variables of the dense run have merged into 9
# nontrivial orbit representatives (plus the identity):

report.invariant_moment_count

# Two smaller PSD constraints, fewer variables, same answer. Useful — but
# this is only the beginning, because SWAP is not the symmetry that does the
# heavy lifting here.

# ## Step 4 — The symmetry you'd probably miss: global Pauli-axis rotations
#
# The Heisenberg coupling is **isotropic**: ``\vec{\sigma}_1 \cdot
# \vec{\sigma}_2`` treats the ``x``, ``y``, ``z`` axes identically. Any global
# spin rotation — the *same* single-qubit unitary applied to every site —
# leaves it invariant. The Clifford subgroup of those rotations is the
# 24-element octahedral group: the rotations that permute the coordinate axes
# ``\pm x, \pm y, \pm z`` among themselves.
#
# Unlike SWAP, these symmetries move no qubit. They act in the *internal*
# Pauli-axis space, permuting the terms of ``H`` among each other. Two
# generators suffice. The **global Hadamard** exchanges the ``x`` and ``z``
# axes on both sites:
#
# ```math
# \sigma_i^x \mapsto \sigma_i^z, \quad
# \sigma_i^z \mapsto \sigma_i^x, \quad
# \sigma_i^y \mapsto -\sigma_i^y \qquad (i = 1, 2),
# ```
#
# which maps ``\sigma_1^x\sigma_2^x \leftrightarrow \sigma_1^z\sigma_2^z`` and
# fixes ``\sigma_1^y\sigma_2^y`` (the two ``-`` signs cancel). Note what just
# happened: this Clifford **permutes the terms of ``H`` without fixing them**
# — no relabeling of qubits can do that. Hamiltonian-level invariance holds
# even though no individual term is invariant.
#
# Single-gate constructors like `CliffordSymmetry(:H, 1)` won't express this —
# a Hadamard on qubit 1 *alone* is not a symmetry (it would map
# ``\sigma_1^x\sigma_2^x`` to ``\sigma_1^z\sigma_2^x``, which is not in ``H``).
# For gates acting on several sites at once, pass an image dictionary
# `source => (sign, target)`:

M = typeof(σx[1])
global_hadamard = CliffordSymmetry(Dict{M,Tuple{Int,M}}(
    σx[1] => (1, σz[1]), σz[1] => (1, σx[1]), σy[1] => (-1, σy[1]),
    σx[2] => (1, σz[2]), σz[2] => (1, σx[2]), σy[2] => (-1, σy[2]),
))

# The **global S gate** is a quarter turn about the ``z`` axis,
# ``\sigma^x \mapsto \sigma^y \mapsto -\sigma^x`` on both sites; it swaps the
# ``\sigma^x\sigma^x`` and ``\sigma^y\sigma^y`` terms and fixes
# ``\sigma^z\sigma^z``:

global_s = CliffordSymmetry(Dict{M,Tuple{Int,M}}(
    σx[1] => (1, σy[1]), σy[1] => (-1, σx[1]),
    σx[2] => (1, σy[2]), σy[2] => (-1, σx[2]),
))

# Together with SWAP, these two generators produce a much larger group —
# NCTSSoS enumerates it and re-verifies invariance of every element:

full_manual_spec = SymmetrySpec(swap, global_hadamard, global_s);

full_manual_config = SolverConfig(
    optimizer    = SILENT_MOSEK,
    moment_basis = basis,
    cs_algo      = NoElimination(),
    ts_algo      = NoElimination(),
    symmetry     = full_manual_spec,
)

full_manual_result = cs_nctssos(pop, full_manual_config);
full_manual_result.objective

# The three generators close into a group of order **48** —
# ``2 \;(\text{SWAP}) \times 24 \;(\text{octahedral axis rotations})``:

full_report = full_manual_result.symmetry
full_report.group_order

# And the SDP collapses: the ``7 \times 7`` PSD block becomes three scalars,

full_report.psd_block_sizes

# with a *single* nontrivial invariant moment left — the common bond
# correlator ``\langle \sigma_1^a \sigma_2^a \rangle``, the same for all three
# axes by symmetry. Every other moment (single-site averages, mixed-axis
# correlators) is forced to zero by some group element:

full_report.invariant_moment_count

# Same exact objective, from an SDP that is barely an SDP anymore. The catch:
# would you have written `global_hadamard` and `global_s` down unprompted —
# and would you trust yourself to have found *all* such generators on a model
# that isn't a two-site textbook exercise? This is the problem automatic
# detection solves.

# ## Step 5 — Automatic SympleQ detection — and its blind spot
#
# [`sympleq_symmetry_spec`](@ref) inspects the Hamiltonian itself. It encodes
# the Pauli terms as a binary symplectic tableau, builds a coloured graph
# whose automorphisms preserve coefficients, commutation relations, and
# ``\mathbb{F}_2``-linear structure, lifts each automorphism to a Clifford
# (including a GF(2) phase solve so the signs work out), and returns only
# generators that verifiably leave ``H`` invariant. Details:
# [Clifford Symmetry Detection](@ref clifford-symmetry-detection).

auto_spec = sympleq_symmetry_spec(H);
length(auto_spec.clifford_generators)

# Solve with the auto-detected symmetry:

auto_config = SolverConfig(
    optimizer    = SILENT_MOSEK,
    moment_basis = basis,
    cs_algo      = NoElimination(),
    ts_algo      = NoElimination(),
    symmetry     = auto_spec,
)

auto_result = cs_nctssos(pop, auto_config);
auto_result.objective

# The detected generators close into a group of order **24**:

auto_report = auto_result.symmetry
auto_report.group_order

# That is precisely the global octahedral rotation group from Step 4 — the
# part of the symmetry a human is likely to *miss*, found automatically with
# no hints. It is already enough to collapse the moment matrix almost
# completely:

auto_report.psd_block_sizes

#

auto_report.invariant_moment_count

# But notice what is **not** there: the group order is 24, not 48. SympleQ did
# not return SWAP. The reason is structural, not a bug. The detection graph
# sees a Clifford only through the *permutation it induces on the terms of*
# ``H`` — and SWAP fixes all three terms ``\sigma_1^a\sigma_2^a``
# individually, so at the term level it is indistinguishable from the
# identity. Cliffords that move operators while fixing every term can
# therefore escape detection (see
# [Scaling and limitations](@ref sympleq-limits)).
#
# The fix is one line: **union the generators you know with the generators
# SympleQ finds.** A [`SymmetrySpec`](@ref) accepts any mix:

combined_spec = SymmetrySpec(auto_spec.clifford_generators..., swap);

combined_config = SolverConfig(

# ## Step 7 — The payoff at scale: 10-site Heisenberg ring at order 2
#
# Steps 1–6 used **order-1** relaxations, where the moment matrices are small
# enough that symmetry overhead can exceed solver time. The real payoff of
# symmetry reduction shows at **higher relaxation orders**, where PSD block
# sizes grow quadratically and the solver’s ``O(k^3)`` cost per block
# dominates.
#
# Consider a 10-site periodic Heisenberg chain, now at **order 2**:
#
# ```math
# H_{10} = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{i=1}^{10}\sum_{a \in \{x,y,z\}}
#        \sigma_i^a\,\sigma_{i+1\,(\mathrm{mod}\,10)}^a.
# ```
#
# At order 2, the half-basis includes all products of up to two single-site
# Pauli operators — 436 monomials instead of 31. To see *where* the time goes,
# we will also report the raw interior-point time inside each total via
# `JuMP.solve_time`.

# ### Where does the remaining time go?
#
# Look at the two speedup numbers separately. The **solver-only** speedup is
# roughly two orders of magnitude: Mosek's share collapses from ~130 s to
# under a second, because ten blocks of side ≤ 51 are vastly cheaper than one
# ``436 \times 436`` block. That is the genuine, exact payoff of symmetry
# reduction — and it grows with system size and relaxation order, since the
# dense solver cost explodes while the reduced blocks stay manageable.
#
# The **end-to-end** speedup is smaller because the symmetry run pays two
# overheads the dense run does not: SympleQ detection (well under a second
# here, and independent of relaxation order) and constructing the
# symmetry-adapted relaxation — decomposing the 436-dimensional representation into isotypic
# blocks and congruence-transforming the moment matrix into them. That
# construction cost grows with the order of the group and the number of
# blocks, not with what the solver does afterwards.
#
# Part of that construction is a **soundness certificate**: replacing one
# big PSD block by small diagonal blocks is only exact if the off-diagonal
# blocks of the transformed moment matrix vanish, and NCTSSoS verifies this
# at runtime rather than trusting the supplied generators blindly. The
# `offblock_check` option of [`SymmetrySpec`](@ref) selects the verification
# mode: the default `:randomized` certificate evaluates every off-diagonal
# block at deterministic pseudo-random values of the moment variables (each
# entry is linear in them, so vanishing at generic points certifies the
# symbolic property); `:full` expands every entry symbolically — an
# order-of-magnitude more construction time, useful for diagnosing a failing
# certificate entry-by-entry; `:off` skips the check.
#
# What about the “union the specs” advice of Step 6? On this ring you can
# union `auto_spec10` with the 10-site translation and reflection (the
# dihedral group ``D_{10}``, exactly as in Step 6). The combined group has
# order **160** and shreds the SDP to 37 blocks of side ≤ 11 with only 179
# moment variables — Mosek then solves it in ~0.1 s. But on the same
# hardware as the run above, building that finer decomposition takes
# roughly twice as long as building the order-16 one, so the total is
# *slower* than `auto_spec10` alone despite the smaller SDP. A bigger group
# always means a smaller SDP, not always a faster total.
#
# Rules of thumb:
#
# - When the solver dominates (large basis, high order, or many repeated
#   solves of the same relaxation), symmetry reduction wins decisively.
# - When a one-shot solve is cheap, or the group is enormous relative to the
#   moment matrix, detection and construction can eat the gains — measure
#   both parts (`JuMP.solve_time` vs. total) before scaling up.

# ### Scaling beyond 10 sites
#
# The gap between dense and symmetry-reduced widens rapidly with system
# size. The numbers below were measured once with the same protocol as the
# live run above (same Heisenberg ring at order 2, same machine — 28 cores,
# 111 GB RAM — Mosek, warm-up runs discarded); they are quoted statically
# because the dense baselines take from twenty minutes to two hours:
#
# | sites | dense total (Mosek) | symmetry total (Mosek) | end-to-end | solver-only | objective difference |
# |:------|:--------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------|:------------|:---------------------|
# | 12 | 1098 s (1093 s) | 31 s (3.1 s) | 35× | 354× | ``8.7 \times 10^{-9}`` |
# | 14 | 6969 s (6957 s) | 102 s (11.8 s) | 68× | 588× | ``4.1 \times 10^{-8}`` |
# | 16 | intractable | 330 s (31.9 s) | — | — | — |
#
# The structure behind those totals: at 12 sites the dense relaxation is a
# single ``631 \times 631`` block with 46,666 moment variables, against 10
# symmetry-adapted blocks of side ≤ 73 with 3,178; at 14 sites,
# ``862 \times 862`` with 91,771 against blocks ≤ 99 with 6,224; at 16
# sites the symmetry-reduced SDP has 10 blocks of side ≤ 129 with 11,077
# moment variables and solves in about five minutes, while the dense
# ``1129 \times 1129`` baseline was not attempted — the 14-site dense solve
# already consumed ~99 of the machine's 111 GB, and both its time and
# memory grow steeply from there. The detected group is the same order-16
# group at every size, found in ≈ 0.5 s.
#
# With no dense run to compare against at 16 sites, is the bound still
# trustworthy? Physics provides the check. Per site, the order-2 bounds are
#
# ```math
# E_{10}/10 = -0.451816,\quad E_{12}/12 = -0.449407,\quad
# E_{14}/14 = -0.447994,\quad E_{16}/16 = -0.447093,
# ```
#
# a monotone family approaching the exact thermodynamic-limit ground-state
# energy per site of the Heisenberg chain, ``1/4 - \ln 2 \approx
# -0.443147``, from below — just as the true finite-ring energies do, with
# every bound below its ring's true energy, as a lower bound must be. The symmetry-reduced numbers agree with the dense
# objectives to ``\sim 10^{-8}`` wherever both exist, and the certificate
# described above guards the block structure at every size.
#
# At these sizes the remaining cost is almost entirely the symmetry-adapted
# *construction* (about 90% of the symmetry total at 16 sites), not the
# solve — so the gap between the two columns is also a roadmap for future
# optimization.

# ## Summary
#
# The 2-site numbers, side by side:
#
# | spec | group order | PSD blocks | invariant moments | objective |
# |:-----|:------------|:-----------|:------------------|:----------|
# | dense baseline | — | `[7]` | 16 | ``-0.75`` |
# | manual SWAP | 2 | `[4, 3]` | 9 | ``-0.75`` |
# | manual SWAP + axis rotations | 48 | `[1, 1, 1]` | 1 | ``-0.75`` |
# | `sympleq_symmetry_spec` | 24 | `[1, 2]` | 1 | ``-0.75`` |
# | auto ∪ manual SWAP | 48 | `[1, 1, 1]` | 1 | ``-0.75`` |
#
# Three takeaways:
#
# 1. **Symmetry reduction is exact** — every row certifies the same bound,
#    only the SDP shrinks. At low orders the overhead is not worth it; by
#    order 2 on 10 qubits the pure solver time drops by two orders of
#    magnitude (~130 s → under a second), and the advantage widens with
#    size — 68× end-to-end at 14 sites, and at 16 sites the symmetry-reduced
#    relaxation solves in minutes where the dense one is out of reach. The
#    remaining overhead — detection plus symmetry-adapted construction —
#    grows with the group order, so the largest group is not automatically
#    the fastest run.
# 2. **Inspection and detection see different things.** Humans spot spatial
#    symmetries (SWAP, translations); SympleQ finds internal, axis-mixing
#    Clifford symmetries that fix no individual term — but can miss Cliffords
#    that fix *every* term, because those induce the identity permutation on
#    the detection graph.
# 3. **So use both.** For production runs, start from
#    `sympleq_symmetry_spec(H)` and splice in the structural generators you
#    know: `SymmetrySpec(auto.clifford_generators..., your_gates...)`. The
#    union is often strictly stronger than either part — as a *reduction*;
#    check Step 7's caveat before assuming it is also faster end-to-end.
