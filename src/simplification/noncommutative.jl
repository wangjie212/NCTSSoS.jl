    NonCommutative Algebra Simplification (Site-Based)

Implements simplification for non-commutative operators with site-based commutation.

# Algebraic Rules
- No simplification rules within a site (order preserved exactly)
- Operators on different sites commute (sorted by site ascending)
- Operators on the same site are non-commutative (order preserved)

# Index Encoding
Indices must be unsigned integers (`T<:Unsigned`) with bit-packed site information.
Use `encode_index(T, operator_id, site)` to create indices.

# Algorithm
1. Group operators by site (using `decode_site`)
2. Sort groups by site (ascending)
3. Within each site: preserve order exactly (no simplification)
4. Concatenate sorted groups

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> using NCTSSoS

julia> using NCTSSoS: encode_index

julia> idx1_s1 = encode_index(UInt16, 1, 1);

julia> idx1_s2 = encode_index(UInt16, 1, 2);

julia> word = simplify(NonCommutativeAlgebra, [idx1_s2, idx1_s1, idx1_s2]);

julia> word == [idx1_s1, idx1_s2, idx1_s2]
true
```

    _validate_word(::Type{NonCommutativeAlgebra}, word::Vector{T}) where {T<:Unsigned}

Check that a noncommutative word is in canonical form. Throws `ArgumentError` if invalid.

Canonical form requirements:
- Sites sorted in ascending order (operators on different sites commute)

This is used by `NormalMonomial{NonCommutativeAlgebra,T}` constructor to enforce invariants.

    simplify!(::Type{NonCommutativeAlgebra}, word::Vector{T}) where {T<:Unsigned} -> Vector{T}

In-place site-aware simplification for non-commutative algebra word vectors.

Operators on different sites commute and are sorted by site (ascending).
Within each site, order is preserved exactly (no simplification rules apply).

Returns the sorted word vector (mutated in place).

1. Filter out zero indices
2. Stable sort by site (using `decode_site`)
3. Within each site: preserve order exactly
